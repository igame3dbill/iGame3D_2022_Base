</font></b><br><br><br>ig3d_GetMeshMaterialInfo_i_s, ig3d_SetMeshMaterialInfo_is, ig3d_SetMeshMaterialInfo_is, ig3d_GetObjectMaterialInfo_si_s and ig3d_SetObjectMaterialInfo_sis<br>are use the multi-line string [materialInfo] parameter (or return value). We are covering the format of this string here.
<br>This string has multiple lines, the first line is the name of the material and the second line contains the number of material instructions that will follow.<br>The other lines are these instructions. They make up the appearance of the material.<br>The instructions are organized in a line-delimited list with one line for each instruction.<br>An instruction has the following syntax: [setting]=[value_1, ..., value_n]<br>The types and amounts of values for a setting vary from setting to setting.<br>NOTE: The material instructions are the same as in the WTF file format!<br>Here is a sample instruction:<br>lux=true<br>This makes the material immune to lighting (takes only one boolean value).
<br><br>Since iGame3D is built on top of OpenGL, most settings you see here do exactly the same as the corresponding OpenGL state function calls.<br>Because the OpenGL functions are well-documented, we are just telling what functions to look for in each setting.<br>Here is a list of all supported settings and their value types:<br>lux=Boolean<br>smooth=Integer<br>color=Real, Real, Real, Real<br>ambient=Real, Real, Real, Real<br>diffuse=Real, Real, Real, Real<br>specular=Real, Real, Real, Real<br>shininess=Real<br>emission=Real, Real, Real, Real<br>blend=Integer<br>texture=Integer,local file string<br>wire=Real<br>depth=Integer<br>shader=local file string<br>"lux":<br>If the value of "lux" is true, then this material will ignore any lighting and will appear at full brightness (use for skyboxes for example).
<br><br>"smooth":<br>If the value of "smooth" is 1, then the material will be smooth-shaded (goraud-shaded). If the material is a mesh material you should first select the mesh
<br>that is using this material and call ig3d_MakeMeshSmoothShaded_b to calculate the vertex normals used in this type of shading.<br>If the value is 0, then the material will be flat-shaded.<br>The value is of type integer because in the future more shading types might be added.<br>"color":<br>Sets the color of the material using four values (red, green, blue and alpha components).
<br><br>"ambient", "diffuse", "specular", "shininess", "emission":<br>See a OpenGL reference for the uses of GL_AMBIENT, GL_DIFFUSE, GL_SPECULAR, GL_SHININESS, GL_EMISSION with the function glMaterialfv.<br>Here's an example: ambient=0.1,0.1,0.1,1.0 would be glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_AMBIENT, {0.1,0.1,0.1,1.0});
<br><br>"blend":<br>If the value of "blend" is 1, then blending will be turned on, which means that the opacity of the material will be determined by the alpha channel<br>of its texture and the alpha value of the "diffuse" setting, 0 meaning complete invisible and 1 meaning opaque.<br>By default, blending is off (blend=0).
<br><br>"texture":<br>The first value is the texture unit and the second value the local path of the texture file to be used. This should be a .png somewhere in iGame3D directory or its subdirectories.<br>The texture unit ranges from 1 to 8, more are not supported by iGame3D. Some graphics cards support less, some support more. Apply textures to multiple units to do multitexturing.<br>If no texture is assigned to any of the units, the material will have the color specified in the "color" setting.<br>Example usage: texture=1,data/images/wood.png<br>"wire":<br>If the value of "wire" is not 0, then the material will be wireframe and the value sets the line width in pixels.<br>"depth":<br>By default the value of "depth" is 1, which means that depth-testing (sometimes called z-testing) is performed when drawing the geometry of this material.
<br>With a value of 0 you can turn this off. You might use this for some blending materials or where depth testing does not matter.<br>"shader":<br>Takes a local path to a folder containing vertex and fragment shader files. Only the Mac version of iGame3D supports vertex and fragment shaders as of now. The specified folder should contain<br>these three files: VertexProgram, FragmentProgram and FragmentProgram_ATI. VertexProgram is written in ARBvp1.0 and FragmentProgram in ARBfp1.0. The FragmentProgram_ATI (language ATIfs1.0)  is used
<br>on cards that don't support FragmentProgram and that concerns a lot of cards used in Macs.<br>This is allows you to apply a custom shader to a material!<br>Example usage: shader=data/Shaders/bump/<br>
