flycam_temp -- Some balls? no action script

letscrash -- UDG Intro Crash test, with no level mesh, nothing happening.
I moved setSceneInfo(IG3D_MOUSE_VIEW, true, 1) into the conditional testing for game mode  of UDG_INIT.LUA 
So annoying to lose the mouse pointer and wiggle the camera around everytime you load a level for testing.

Added:
if ig3d_GetMode__i() == 4 then
if UIMainTools then UIMainTools:hide() end
end  

to UDG_IntroCredits/load script.lua so the GUI hides when play mode is active but before  UDG_Init.lua runs for the main game.
Noted that UDG_IntroCredits has some scripts floating around in it's level folder, maybe should move those to the UDG scripts folder?

Something in UDG is still reference RTS_Functions
OKAY a bit of stuff still relies on RTS scripts.

Updated UDG_Options.fl to write gCurrentLevel after selecting a level and to go directly to game mode so UDG_Init stuff actually runs, it was not doing that if loading in editor mode and then choosing play from the menu.


performance <<-- 100 animated models, seems to run okay, now try with AStar path finding, see what that grinds down to.

pers <<-- Image and MAtrix Captrurer again, not sure the purpose.

Postman <<-- simple sample game, updated path for math.functions.lua, moved necesarry images, emitters, models,etc to current Windows igame3d directories.
This contains a lot of scripts in the Level folder...they have been moved to
Data/Scripts/Games/Postman_Functions and the load script has been updated to reflect that.




RagdollDebug <<-- super spazzy ragdoll  


Studio -- Seems to be same level as Utility/Studio 
I commented out the levelMesh loading since the mesh seemed to make no difference
Moving to UTILITY/Studio, fixed the paths in the load script for the images to export there
There was a girl.obj in the level folder, moved to Data/OBJ


testosteron << -- empty testing level REMOVED
FYI
dofile(gameroot.."Data/Scripts/Default/default_Globals.lua")
within a load script breaks things, have to figure out why.
