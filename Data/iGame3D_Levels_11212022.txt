These tests were made with Windows Visual Studio build 2013

Bike -- TRON Lightcycle uses version of the CAR level script, camera freaks out but
otherwise works, although there's no engine sound or breaking texture.
Aliens and crate stuff was commented out.

BobetteSoccer  -- fixed path:
 if console==nil then dofile(gameroot.."Data/GUI/console/console.fl") end

Okay apparently loading the console from within the game or during the game
causes it to crash, console.lua must be having an issue on it's own.
This level was screaming in the console about not being able to open the game root folder path ...for whatever reason
camresetter function had
--setCameraInfo(IG3D_POSITION, -7.488011, 11.233835, 3.243137)
--setCameraInfo(IG3D_ROTATION, 49.487797, 125.060448, -0.000000)
and
--fltk_update()
as the camera stuff was freaking the camera out and the fltk thing didn't do anything useful.

Otherwise BobbetteSoccer is working


BrickFun - Works. Interesting Editor mouse/3D widget is active during game mode

Car - WORKS. Camera freaks out though, for whatever reason.

Car_n_Driver -- was missing level mesh, redirected to Car level mesh
Seems the car is constantly applying the brake
Ragdolls work
Space key and/or mouse click crashes it
Can't get back to editor mode and/or regain mouse pointer


Colltests  -- fixed console path and this doesn't do any of the buggy stuff Bobette was doing with the console open. Otherwise works.


cubmaptest -- DELETED Didn't do anything. just a default script.

default -- default script, empty level mesh, redudant default_Globals.lua

FPS -- WORKS

HelloWorld -- WORKS


iFly
iFly function paths moved to Data/Scripts/Games/iFly_Functions
base iFly level load script now loads Data/Levels/iFly/iFly_Title
iFly standard game play script has been placed in Data/Levels/iFly/iFly_Game
iFly_Title has been changed to load that script on "continue"



iFly_Briefing path to jets fixed, click now starts game immediately

iFly_Game...script from 2013 replaced with script from 2009, the 2013 script wasn't turning the plane with mouse move, maybe 2013 script was modified for iPhone?
The Enemy Pointers fontPNG was missing, added back into the Data folder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
iFly_Controls and iFly_Options 
had the following added to loop function so "BACK" button went to iFly_Title instead of game play, it was not clearing the text boxes otherwise, and the iFly_Title text was not selectable after the switch.

if load== true then
  load = false
  gTextboxes={}
for i=1,#gTextboxFonts,1 do
	gTextboxes[i]=make(ig3d_text_box, gTextboxFonts[i])
	setText_boxInfo(gTextboxes[i], IG3D_TEXT, "")
  end
 loadLevel("Data/Levels/iFly/iFly_Title")
end
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

iPhoneCar -- don't have iPhone so can't test this
iPhoneHelloWorld -- don't have iPhone so can't test this

level-1 -- REMOVED EMPTY
level-2 -- REMOVED EMPTY

MedeivalHouse2 -- A nice free house that was a pain in the ass to invert 2 normals

NXTpbLuaSim -- Chrimo's project from 2008, weird thing, has some text display stuff for position and FPS (3512 Fps?!?!?) that might be a useful example, after cleaning up. Fixed a path to ifly_math functions.
This is notable need to remember this:
-- this avoids unwanted behaviours with wrong initialition
delete(ig3d_scene)

Pong -- Paddles were missing, still don't know how to make the ball bouncey.
Materials collision detection? Bones?

Recognizer -- Works better than it ever has. Saved as new style load script, old script to drive the Rec around has been updated.

Simple -- Contains some examples, let's put them back into the main level folder and remove this one.
Redundant and Removed >>> BobetteSoccer, FpS, HelloWorld, UFO

BROKEN DOOR, shows a door breaking ooh magic

A_Level_Menu >> Ye olde default wiggly level menu screen
For some reason reloading:
 dofile(gameroot.."Data/Scripts/Default/default_Globals.lua")
Really mucks up the whole game engine. So that's commented out.

SquigLand -- WORKS AS ALWAYS

Tank -- Same script as Recognizer but it the airborne() bool grinds the object to a halt. 
Also Tanks uses: player=get(ig3d_object, "trontankwbase1") 
While Recognizer uses:  player=gObjects[1].cObj
Yet Car uses: car=gObjects[1]
That car version didn't work for Recognizer level at all.



testing123 -- BVH testing level so Renamed to testingBVH
"Data/BVH/FreeBVH/BoxerWarming1.bvh" was missing, has been added
listAnims = ModelAnimationList("truebonesmaster1") -- was looking for gObjectNames[1] but the object is loaded by  "Data/Scripts/Examples/truebonesbvh_parser.lua" so gObjectNames is not updated with the correct data.



testLEvel --- Did nothing, REMOVED.

Third Person <<-- Squigland again, maybe we should update with an animated character

Tronish <<< Just a display level, REMOVED

udeadgames << Whats going on here? Fixed a script path, it loaded a very strange UDG map, with an oversized (like 500%) zombie all distorted and weird, I moved around a map a bit, saw a human eating a snack but he was half in the floor, then the game ended because all the zombies died (from falling into the ether I think)

UDG -- Updated all the scripts to load from path: "Data/Scripts/Games/UDG_Functions/UDG_Init.lua"

UFO -- Works as it usual


ufotest <-- EMPTY LEVEL REMOVED

Utility <--- Contains some more levels
	AnimazooBVH <-- these BVH are not available at the moment
	boninglevel <-- Forgot how that works
	Studio <-- whats that do?
	TrueBonesBVH <--- crashed on load

Warhammer -- can not open "..Data/Levels/Warhammer/tools/mathe.lua": No such file or directory

ZFPS <<-- Hmm this is just plain broken, it was UDG before UDG was finished?

ZGS -- Works! All the guns are extra big, so funny. Vehicle is extra big and don't work.

ZGS_default --- was pointing to RTS_Init and was broken and crashed, it did spit out a bunch of data text on screen before it crashed. Changed the path to ZGS_Init and it works, even the car works! But there's a freaky distorted giant zombie, have to "Zombie.wtf" it seems is super low poly, has no texture and his bones are are a mess because he gets all bent out of shape.
