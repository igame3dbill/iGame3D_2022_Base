# Basic Passthrough by James A. McCombe, Tue Jun 17 2003
#
# Very basic example of a fragment program.  Simply samples texture unit 0 and
# modulates with the interpolated vertex color
#
# Texture units:
#   Unit 0 - Base texture map

StartOutputPass;
	SampleMap r0, t0.str;    # Sample the texture at the modified texture coordinates
	
	MUL r0, r0, color0;
EndPass;
