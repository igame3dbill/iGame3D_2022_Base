We hear moans. 

The snow has stopped.

There's fire and smoke in the dark.

There are people lying around the wreck and ooze.
Some alive.

This runs in the background of the options screen.
Randomly it will start snowing for a random time.
Occasionally we hear "help","please help",
Less occasionally, like every minute it will say deep and sincere "so hungry".
Randomly the radio will static and some music will play.

Controls:
ZOMBIES SHOULD NOT RUSH ATTACK UNLESS GIVEN A COMMAND TO.
Mouse Click Commands zombies.
	Default:
	Number keys = how many zombies will move, fall, or rush with each action.
	If you have 9 zombies and use all their rush at once, without success you are 	pretty much sitting ducks.
	
	For movement.
	W A S D 
	
	Mouse send zombies forward in slow motion.
	Each click will go through the zombie ranks and send 1 to 9 zombies forward.
	
	Lets not make a target necessary, any click anywhere will send zombies
	in that direction. 
	
	This way we can command them to retreat before they get   blown to bits.
	Or go stand around loitering some section while look in another direction.
	
	Clicking on doors or obstacles will cause zombies to attack it.
	A zombie attacking an obstacle will be stunned after it breaks.
	Use two or more zombies to guarantee you can eat whats in the package.
	
	Click on a human will  set him as a target for the zombies.
	The zombie will not rush unless told to. Rush is to be used with skill!
	
	F = FALL (everytime its clicked the last  zombie in the rank list plays dead,
			they will get up and follow and devour anything alive that 
			walks past 	them. They have a random but brief re-awake time.)
			
			FALLEN Zombies go to the bottom of the rank list, 
			
			They will not move to commands unless zombies above them are 					destroyed, or a human has woken them up and they ate it.
			
			FALLEN zombies can be used to safeguard a few of your horde 
			before say walking into a sniper attack.
			
			FALLEN zombies can be a defense against shooters as they
			also drop from targeting.
			
				
		SPECIAL: Soldier zombies that FALL down  will pull a grenade 					instead of getting up to eat, use wisely. 
		This will be useuful against SWAT later on. 
		Shooting homicide victims to make sure they are dead is not 
		part of their protocol...to their disadvantage.
			
						
	R = RUSH, each time this is pressed a zombie will race forward
		and attack the first thing it finds or its specificied target.
		
		Zombies can Rush for half as many units as they have health.
		If it reaches its max units without eating , it loses its 
		target and has 	to go back into zombie speed until it eats again.    
		 It also goes to bottom rank as soon as rush begins.
		 
		A Rush works better against a door, but at a cost.
		If the door breaks on the rush attack, the zombie goes down
		for a third of as many seconds as it has health.
		If the door does not break on a rush attack, the zombies takes one 
		tenth of its health in damage.
		A rush attack against a door does one quarter of a zombies health 
		in damage to the door.
		
	
		 
		
		
-----------------------------------------------------------------		
Level One: Risen
Camera goes upright.
We look very sluggishly around to see two people 
in the  immediate wreckage, they are covered 
in the black slime and eating it?!?!
From our left we hear "help, oh god you're alive, please help me!"

Instructional: "Click on the living to interact with them."

Click, the two slime covered people rush forward and attack.
The zombie count that was three increases to four.

Now we are four zombies, in the snow, with nowhere to go
but back up the road from whence we came.

A short distance down the road there is a car stuck off road.
"Hey man if you can get me out of this ditch I'll give you a lift out of the cold"
Munch!

A bit further there is the "Living Inn"! Mostly vacant. 
A few guests leave their rooms or open their doors just in time to die.


A little farther there is a dead end blocked by a fence, to the left is "Poncho Co." 
The front of the building is sealed but a door by the loading bay is open awaiting
that truck we crashed into. 



----------------------------------------------------
Fade To White : Play wicked drawn out guitar chord
 Level Two: Out of the cold.

We've entered a Hallway, at then end and right is an office.
Voice over as we approach from behind a man on cell phone (bvh!)
"He said he'd be here an hour ago, I know how important this shipment is, but I can't exactly go looking for him in a blizzard, what the hell, you pay me just enough to keep  my mouth shut and take the risks I already take. When he gets here he gets here." 

"Huh? Bob is that you? I just got my aaaaaggh!" 
Phone guy gets eaten.


There is a glass office door. It needs to be smashed.
Clicking on the door will set the strongest zombie against it.
This door will take one attack, the zombie smashes right through
with a flying leap attack, lays down  until the rest of the 
zombies move forward. Perhaps we could put them in ranks
that way, if they go down they go to the bottom of the rank list?

We are in a hallway, there are exits east and west.
West leads past some smaller loading bay type doors, and around a corner.

East leads to a larger office in  the South wall.
East: 
An office room with desks.

Voice over: "Yeah it looks like a bunch of us are going to have to sleep here.
There's a hotel down the road, but I don't even think we could make it that far. Steve left an hour ago, I hope he made it home ok, you know how he drives.
Ha! Yeah, that bastard would come back from the dead, just to make us work for him. Crazy thing is, I think I'd rise from my grave and do it too."

Munch! Jimbo dies. And rises.

Door to west leads to an office supplies room. 
It takes ten good hits to open the door and the zombie or
zombies doing it will be stunned when it finally crashes down.

Banging on this door will alert the three people inside.
One will arm himself with a broom, killing one of our zombies 
heroically before dieing.

The other two will be easy prey.

Another glass door south in the office  leads to a hallway.
South2:
Hallway leads to closed doors, too strong to break.
At the end of the hallway  cleaning man Fernando pushes a mop, with his back to us. Munch.
Back to the North, then West, continuing West past the loading docks.
(the door we entered is closed after killing Gary.)

The Hallway turns south, then splits east and west twice before ending
at another glass door(one that will knock a few zombies down before it breaks).

During our shuffle south, we will stumble across Phil and Henry, two security guards  that are checking the doors in the hallway area. 

One we will  see  us from a distance outright, the other will appear (as if from nowhere! but from one of the rooms behind us) and start blasting zombies. He will hide behind unbreakable doors, reload and sneak out to menace us if he's not stopped. He can get to the other rooms behind the doors through a back cooridoor that connects them.

Phil is a good shot, we lose a few of our horde to his pistol before we are done.

After Phil joins the crew we can  take down the glass door (we are sitting ducks trying to do that if we don't take down Phil and Henry, and they will follow us, picking off the back zombies if we aren't paying attention).

The glass door leads to a lobby area, which leads back outdoors across a courtyard with a high wall around it. Its not snowing, but everything is white.
There are lights in the courtyard, and lights in the room with the glass door.
Just as we reach the doors the lights will flicker and go out.

Only if we have Phil and/or Henry the door slides open thanks to their RFID Security Badges. 

As we enter the near pitch black room, the emergency lights will kick on.
They will be red, it will be dark.
And everyone in the cafeteria will scream after we get our first munch
and they'll crowd around three exit doors.
One of which won't open because of snow and ice.
The second door will lead across a snowed in parking lot to another building.
The third door will lead to offices and labs.

The cafeteria is critical. There are ten people.
If anyone escapes and reaches their escape destination, they will call for help.

SWAT TEAM HELP!
A swat team will arrive on the next level if someone has escaped, 
They will come from behind, their  first volley of attack will take 
down some of our horde with head shots before we can turn around and munch.

It should happen totally by surprise, even in an ambush situation, ie a big room with a victim in the middle for us to be attracted to while they hide in the recessess. Or against a large door we have to pound and are stuck at for a while.


First Hero:
One will try to play hero with his glock, he has an extra mag.
He can kick away zombies and not get hurt until he's out of ammo.
He'll shoot any zombie that attacks him, and any zombie thats feeding.
His shots will act as a strobe effect in the reddened room.
A third of his shots will kill a zombie outright, 
another third  will knock them down, all his melee attacks will knock them down.

When he is defeated he will become top rank, and have the most health, so whatever the top health of the current zombies is, he gets five more.

AFTER THE CAFETERIA.
We can go through one of two doors, one leading to the other buildings south.

----------------------------------------------
Level Three: The Gauntlet.
SWAT will be alerted in this level if 
it wasn't in the last, therefore showing up in the next level.
IF SWAT has been alerted, chances of surviving this level should be slim.

Super dark hallway, with a security door at the end.
Its assumed that we have plenty of RFID to open the door now.
Fade to black and load the level.

VO:"Shhhh I think its them."
Sound Effects, doors shutting.

Fade in to a long hallway, a very long hallway.
At the end is another security door, which we see only because
of the lone security light shining on it.

All the doors will be locked.
Pounding on them will take at least ten beatings to break.
This will occupy a few zombies.

If there is someone alive inside they will scream only half the time.
If there are two people inside, one will have a weapon.
One in four people has a gun.

When we reach halfway down the hallway the 
Security office doors at the end fly open.
Four Security Guys are at the ready.
"Fire at will boys!"
Kapow Kapow Kapow
The security officers are totalling our newly acquired zombie horde.
They have 24 shots each, they have to reload every twelve.
They will shut the doors if a rush tried but is not successful.
Pounding these doors will  take at least two zombies ten hits each.
There are two doors and they both have to be beaten.

Just before the door goes down voice over:
 "Get the hell out of here, Sheila and I will hold them off!"
The pounders will be punished for their vandalism by Sheila the Shotgun.
Chuck has eight shots, and then he'll try to club as many zombies as he can.

When Chuck dies.
VO from behind: "They got chuck, they got chuck!"
Screaming.
"Oh my god! what the hell are they!?!"
"Run away."
"Not without a fight!" Kapow kapow kapow.

Any remaining people from the rooms in the hallway are now out.
Anyone with guns opens fire.
Anyone with melee weapons waits at a door to attack zombies.
Anyone without a weapon runs back through the direction we came in from.
Anyone who runs out of ammo dodges into a room to reload, 
leaving the melee person for defense.

Melee weapon people will wait until a zombie is right on them  and strike,
killing in half attacks, otherwise a knockdown.

If anyone is hit by friendly fire, or is attacked and takes damage they
will run away, to die behind enemy lines and rise in seven seconds.
However they will act as FALLEN dead and wait for a victim or other ranking zombies to die. 

After the gauntlet.
We can pound the door the other three Security Officers escaped through.
It will lead to a basement tunnel that reaches back around to the other 
building in level four.

Or go back out through the Cafeteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL FOUR: Tunnels
A Long tunnel that winds down long tunnels.
The three remaining security guards are in the tunnels
They will unload from a distance (with less accuracy),
and then retreat down the tunnels toward the basement
of the other building.
Leaving the next guy to sit in wait around the next corner and long tunnel.

He'll have as much ammo as it takes for us to get halfway close to him, and then run. 

They should be a tough fight. 
Zombies should be failing rush attacks by
now but will gain some ground that way.

It should be dark, only the flash of the gun should light the hallway
except for exit signs glowing red at the end of each hallway to orient us.

LEVEL FOUR EXITS INTO an OPEN ELEVATOR BELOW LEVEL SEVEN
The electricty will come back on and we skip Level Sevens Lobby.
Losing a few zombies to the basement...or perhaps reserving them?

LEVEL FIVE: Cafeteria.
Return through dark tunnel and fade from black.
 We are greeted by a hail of bullets by the three remaining security guards. 
They are spread out around the cafeteria.
They will open fire, and run out the doors if we get too close.
Again only a succesful rush should get anyone of them.

The Cafeteria leads to other levels and is a Save point.

If we go back through the levels we started from its a fight against increasing waves of SWAT, we can make it as far as the loading dock, but at that door there's a flame thrower and we all get cooked, game over.


If we go back out the Second opened exit from the Cafeteria:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL SIX: SNIPER'S WALK
There is a snowed in parking lot outside a wide exit with one open door.
Its snowing, its a whiteout, a building is dimly lit across the landscape.
Some victims running to it the distance, scream.

Naturally we follow.


IF ANYONE ESCAPED THE CAFETERIA:
A third of the way across the parking lot.
THUCK THUCK THUCK THUCK THUCK THUCK, helicopter noises come from 
in front of us and behind us. Looking up we only see snow.

There is only one way to go as the snow has been plowed into walls
leading to the other buidling.

Halfway across the frozen waste.
Kapow, Kapow, Kapow!
Flashes from above
Head shots! 
The  snipers have arrived.

One shot every second.
Every first two shots are a knock downs.
Every third shot is a head shot.
There is no way to find the snipers...
Wandering around looking for them is certain death.

Rush for the next building!
But this will use up all your rush until you feed again, theoretically.
If you even survive the snipers.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL SEVEN:  Poncho Co. Building Two Ground Floor.
The Glass windows leading into the office stop us for a while.
Snipers will be tagging our zombies. 

If nobody escaped the Cafeteria this is the first we'll see of the Snipers.
Same rules as above for killing us off, except, if we are down
to half the zombies we started with, a bullet will shatter the
glass windows we are pounding on and the shooting will stop.

Otherwise have windows shatter after say forty strikes total.

We get out of the cold into a dark lobby leading to a security desk,
leading to a row of elevators, where one door is stuck open in the darkness.
The stairwell fire door will take 100 strikes to break, It will be reveal
a stairwell in the dark.
Tink Tink Tink
Boom Grenades!
The stairwell is oblviteration, don't go there.
But there's only one way to know that. ;-)

Entering the Elevator, the elecricity comes back on.

Muzak Plays.
The doors are closing.
Ratta tat tat
Whatever zombies are left out in the hall are 
annihilated by invading swat forces.
Zombies groan and moan and screech.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL EIGHT: Poncho Co. Building Two Ground Floor.
The Elevators open to Second floor.
There are hallways, there are rooms and offices.
There are people in offices who thought themselvs safe on the second floor.
There are windows. 

Soldiers and special agents just keep coming,
until you either die, or eat your way
all the way back to the beginning of the game, down the road,
where the army is waiting for you with flame throwers
and machine guns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL NINE: DEATH SCENARIO
Fade slowly to black from last scene where you died.
ZZZZIP 
"Thats the last bag I had in the truck."
"I'll go out and see if there are anymore"
"Well I'm not waiting in here"
"Dude, They,  aint getting up."
Click-Clack a door closes


Fade from black to last death scene with body bags lying around.
The last unbagged body gets up.
Play Guitar Rift
